    "<h4 style=\"color:#1a73e8;\">2.2.1 Descriptive Statistics: The Five Key Measures</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "For any numerical feature, these statistics tell its story. Let's use a sample of house prices: `[200, 250, 300, 300, 350, 400, 500, 1000]` (in $1,000s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Mean (Average)**: The balance point of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Notation**: \n",
    "```\n",
    "μ = (1/n) × Σ(x_i) for i=1 to n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean = (200 + 250 + 300 + 300 + 350 + 400 + 500 + 1000) / 8\n",
    "     = 3300 / 8\n",
    "     = 412.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: The \"typical\" price is $412,500. But is it representative? Notice the $1,000,000 house pulls the mean upward. The mean is **sensitive to outliers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: When data is normally distributed and has no extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Median**: The middle value when sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation**:\n",
    "- Sort the data: `[200, 250, 300, 300, 350, 400, 500, 1000]`\n",
    "- For even number of points: Average the two middle values\n",
    "- Middle values: 300 and 350\n",
    "- Median = (300 + 350) / 2 = 325\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: Half the houses cost less than $325,000, half cost more. The median is **robust to outliers** (unlike the mean). Notice how the $1M house doesn't affect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: When data has outliers or is skewed. Often more representative than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Mode**: The most frequent value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation**:\n",
    "- Count frequencies: 200 (1), 250 (1), 300 (2), 350 (1), 400 (1), 500 (1), 1000 (1)\n",
    "- Mode = 300 (appears twice)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: $300,000 is the most common price in this sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: For categorical data or when you need to know the most common value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Variance and Standard Deviation**: Measures of spread (how much values vary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance Formula**: \n",
    "```\n",
    "σ² = (1/n) × Σ(x_i - μ)² for i=1 to n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation Steps**:\n",
    "1. Calculate mean: μ = 412.5\n",
    "2. For each value, calculate (x_i - μ)²:\n",
    "   - (200 - 412.5)² = 45,156.25\n",
    "   - (250 - 412.5)² = 26,406.25\n",
    "   - (300 - 412.5)² = 12,656.25\n",
    "   - (300 - 412.5)² = 12,656.25\n",
    "   - (350 - 412.5)² = 3,906.25\n",
    "   - (400 - 412.5)² = 156.25\n",
    "   - (500 - 412.5)² = 7,656.25\n",
    "   - (1000 - 412.5)² = 345,156.25\n",
    "3. Sum: 455,250\n",
    "4. Divide by n: 455,250 / 8 = 56,906.25\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Deviation Formula**: \n",
    "```\n",
    "σ = √(variance) = √(σ²)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation**: \n",
    "```\n",
    "σ = √56,906.25 ≈ 238.55\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: Prices are, on average, about $238,550 away from the mean. High variance/standard deviation = high uncertainty/risk. Low variance = values are clustered close to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use**: \n",
    "- Variance: For mathematical operations (it's in squared units)\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: For interpretation (it's in original units, easier to understand)\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Skewness and Kurtosis**: Shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness**: Measures asymmetry.\n",
    "- **Formula**: Skewness = (3 × (Mean - Median)) / Standard Deviation\n",
    "- **Positive skew** (right tail): Mean > Median. Common in income, house prices, reaction times\n",
    "  - Example: Most people earn $50k, but a few earn $500k, pulling the mean right\n",
    "- **Negative skew** (left tail): Mean < Median. Common in exam scores (ceiling effect)\n",
    "  - Example: Most students score 80-100, few score very low\n",
    "- **Zero skew**: Symmetric distribution (like a normal distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kurtosis**: Measures \"tailedness\" (how many outliers).\n",
    "- **High kurtosis**: Heavy tails, more outliers (e.g., financial returns, extreme events)\n",
    "- **Low kurtosis**: Light tails, fewer outliers, more uniform distribution\n",
    "- **Normal kurtosis**: Baseline (kurtosis = 3 for \"excess kurtosis\")\n",
