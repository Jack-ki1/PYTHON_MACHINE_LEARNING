    "<h3 style=\"color:#fbbc05;\">2.1 Collecting Data: The First Step in Any ML Project</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can build a model, you need data. In industry, data comes from three primary sources, each with its own considerations, advantages, and challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4 style=\"color:#1a73e8;\">2.1.1 Open-Source Datasets</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are invaluable for learning, prototyping, and benchmarking. They're free, well-documented, and often come with example code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Sources**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaggle Datasets** (`kaggle.com/datasets`)\n",
    "   - **What it is**: The world's largest data science community with millions of datasets\n",
    "   - **Types**: Everything from Titanic passenger lists to satellite imagery to financial data\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: \n",
    "     - Datasets are often cleaned and documented\n",
    "     - Community discussions and kernels (example code)\n",
    "     - Competitions provide real-world problems\n",
    "   - **Industry Example**: A fintech startup prototypes a credit risk model using the \"Give Me Some Credit\" dataset before accessing their proprietary user data. This allows them to test algorithms and validate approaches without risking sensitive customer information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UCI Machine Learning Repository** (`archive.ics.uci.edu/ml`)\n",
    "   - **What it is**: A long-standing academic repository maintained by UC Irvine\n",
    "   - **Types**: Classic datasets used in research papers (Iris, Wine, Adult Income, etc.)\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: \n",
    "     - Well-documented with metadata\n",
    "     - Used in research, so results are comparable\n",
    "     - Clean, structured format\n",
    "   - **Industry Example**: Researchers at a hospital use the UCI \"Heart Disease\" dataset to validate a new diagnostic feature before clinical trials. This helps them understand data requirements and expected performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Government & Public Data**\n",
    "   - **USA**: `data.gov` (housing, climate, economic indicators, transportation)\n",
    "   - **EU**: `data.europa.eu` (European Union open data)\n",
    "   - **UK**: `data.gov.uk` (UK government data)\n",
    "   - **World Bank**: `data.worldbank.org` (global economic and social data)\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: \n",
    "     - Real-world, often large-scale data\n",
    "     - Updated regularly\n",
    "     - Free and legally safe to use\n",
    "   - **Industry Example**: A logistics company uses U.S. Department of Transportation data to predict highway congestion. This real-time data helps them optimize delivery routes and reduce fuel costs.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What is an API?** An API is a way for different software systems to communicate. In data collection, APIs let you request data from a server and receive it in a structured format (usually JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common API Use Cases**:\n",
    "- **Weather data**: For agricultural yield prediction, energy demand forecasting\n",
    "- **Financial data**: Stock prices, exchange rates, economic indicators\n",
    "- **Social media**: Twitter, Reddit (with rate limits and terms of service)\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Product prices, reviews, inventory levels\n",
